This module for Angular.js [UI Router][ui-router] allows you to specify
CSS-resources for different states. It will make sure that specified
styles are loaded before the state is rendered.

With it, you could split your application into fully-independent layout
sections and get rid of style conflicts once and for all!


## Features

- Simple installation, no directives needed
- Straightforward and flexible resource definition
- Supports named resources with ability to override them down the chain
- All CSS is loaded during the `resolve` stage


## Installation

### Install library with *npm*

`npm i --save betsol-ng-ui-router-styles`


### Install library with *Bower*

`bower install --save betsol-ng-ui-router-styles`


### Add library to your page

``` html
<script src="/node_modules/betsol-ng-ui-router-styles/dist/betsol-ng-ui-router-styles.js"></script>
```

You should use minified version (`betsol-ng-ui-router-styles.min.js`) in production.


### Add dependency in your application's module definition

``` javascript
var application = angular.module('application', [
  // ...
  'betsol.uiRouterStyles'
]);
```


## Usage

```javascript

angular
  .module('application', [
    'betsol.uiRouterStyles'
  ])
  .config(function ($stateProvider) {
    $stateProvider
      .state('root', {
        abstract: true,
        data: {
          // Single un-named resource defined:
          // Globally for entire application.
          css: '/css/root.css'
        }
      })
        .state('home', {
          url: '/',
          parent: 'root',
          data: {
            // Multiple named resources defined:
            // You could override them down the chain if you want.
            css: {
              home: '/css/home.css',
              dashboard: '/css/dashboard.css'
            }
          }
        })
          .state('home-about', {
            url: '/about',
            parent: 'home',
            data: {
              css: {

                // Disabling parent named resource:
                // You could also override it if you want.
                dashboard: null,

                // Adding another named resource:
                about: '/css/about.css',
              }
            }
          })
        .state('sign-up', {
          url: '/sign-up',
          parent: 'root',
          data: {
            // Mixed array-style definition.
            css: [

              // Un-named resource defined by URL:
              '/css/forms.css',

              // Complete resource definition object provided:
              { id: 'sign-up', url: '/css/sign-up.css' },

              // Minimal resource definition object with no name:
              { url: '/css/forms-extra.css' }

            ]
          }
        })
      ;
    })
;


```

## Events

This module fires the following events on the `$rootScope`:

- `uiRouterStyles.loadingStarted` when loading of stylesheets is started
- `uiRouterStyles.loadingFinished` when loading of stylesheets is finished

You can use these events to, for example, hide the content of the page using some animation
in order to prevent [FOUC][fouc].
